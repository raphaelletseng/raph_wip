Hi! I'm Raph, a final year Mathematics and Computer Science major at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada.
I am interested in:
- exploring artificial intelligence in areas where it can affect positive social and environmental change
- the ethics of AI  <br>

This semester, I worked under **[Prof. Jin Guo](http://jguo-web.com/)** in the [Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)](http://jguo-web.com/lab.html) lab, researching the impact of fairness mitigation techniques on privacy preserving Machine Learning. This summer, I'm looking forward to being part of the [2021 AI4Good lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/).

On campus, I am part of the **[McGill Artificial Intelligence Society](http://mcgillai.com)**, where I have met a lovely community of humans who share and broaden my interests! I also volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with **[Earth Hero](https://www.earthhero.org)**, another awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.  

I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats. I am currently fostering a tiny, energetic kitty from the [SPCA](https://www.spca.com/en/) named Valentin.

Send me a **[message](mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com)** if you're interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!
