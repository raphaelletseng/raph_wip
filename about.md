Hi! I'm Raph. I'm currently an Associate Consultant at Slalom, Montreal, Canada. I have a degree in Mathematics and Computer Science from McGill University.
I am interested in:
- exploring artificial intelligence and software in areas where it can affect positive social and environmental change
- the ethics of AI  <br>

This year, I worked under **[Prof. Jin Guo](http://jguo-web.com/)** in the [Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)](http://jguo-web.com/lab.html) lab, researching the impact of fairness mitigation techniques on privacy preserving Machine Learning. I also participated in the **[2021 AI4Good lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/)**, where I worked on Datallite, a dashboard that uses satellite imagery to address data droughts in developing regions to better inform policies that impact social development, specifically education inequality.

I volunteer in my spare time as a web developer with **[Earth Hero](https://www.earthhero.org)**, an awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.  

I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and have a soft spot for cats. I am currently fostering a tiny, energetic, orange kitty from the **[SPCA](https://www.spca.com/en/)** named Valentin.

Send me a **[message](mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com)** if you're interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!
