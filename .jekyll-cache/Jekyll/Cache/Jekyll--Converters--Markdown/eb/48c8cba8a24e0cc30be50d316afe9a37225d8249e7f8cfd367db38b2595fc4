I"<p><em>19th Nov 2021</em> - Edited note: I used the terms ‘unfairness mitigation’ and ‘bias mitigation’ interchangably in this report. I think the correct term should be ‘unfairness mitigation’. In the paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12544.pdf">The Myth of Complete AI-Fairness</a>, Virginia Dignum makes the point that not all bias is bad, and bias in human data is impossible to fully eliminate. <strong>“Bias is not the problem,”</strong> they write, <strong>“prejudice and discrimination are.”</strong></p>
