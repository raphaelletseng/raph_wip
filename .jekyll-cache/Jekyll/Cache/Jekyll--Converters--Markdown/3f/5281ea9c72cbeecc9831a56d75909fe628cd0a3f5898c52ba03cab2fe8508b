<p>In the past, I have worked under <strong><a href="http://jguo-web.com/">Prof. Jin Guo</a></strong> in the <a href="http://jguo-web.com/lab.html">Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)</a> lab, researching the impact of fairness mitigation techniques on privacy preserving Machine Learning.</p>

<p>I also participated in the <strong><a href="https://www.ai4goodlab.com/">2021 AI4Good lab</a></strong>, where I worked on Datallite, a dashboard that uses satellite imagery to address data droughts in developing regions to better inform policies that impact social development, specifically education inequality.</p>

<p>I have also volunteered as a web developer with <strong><a href="https://www.earthhero.org">Earth Hero</a></strong>, an awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.</p>

<p>I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and enjoy rock climbing. I have a soft spot for cats and occasionally foster for the <strong><a href="https://www.spca.com/en/">SPCA</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Send me a <strong><a href="mailto:raphaelletseng@gmail.com">message</a></strong> if youâ€™re interested in working together (Or if you have cute cat photos to share)!</p>
