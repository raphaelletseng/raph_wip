<p>The Malayan tiger has been listed as critically endangered by the <a href="http://www.wwf.org.my/?19945/The-Malayan-tiger-is-officially-Critically-Endangered">IUCN Red List</a>, the worldâ€™s most comprehensive inventory of the conservation status of species. It faces challenges on two major fronts:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Loss of habitat through deforestation and logging</li>
  <li>Poaching for wildlife trade</li>
</ol>

<p>Why is the Malayan tiger on the brink of extinction? And what must be done if we hope to save it?</p>

<h2 id="why-is-the-malayan-tiger-so-important">Why is the Malayan Tiger so important?</h2>

<p>The Malayan tiger is one of the smallest tiger species. Measuring 250 cm in length on average, they are carnivores, surviving off a diet of various types of deer and other animals. Up until 2004, they were believed to be the same species as the Indochinese tiger, until DNA testing revealed them to be an entirely separate subspecies, unique to the Peninsula and the Southern tip of Thailand.</p>

<p>The tiger is an apex predator and its role in the food web is essential. It keeps populations in check, maintaining the balance between herbivores and vegetation. It is commonly said that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg-XWADEpWM&amp;t=159s">â€˜when tigers thrive, so do our forestsâ€™</a> as the presence of tigers is <a href="https://www.wwfindia.org/about_wwf/priority_species/bengal_tiger/why_save_the_tigers/">â€˜an indicator of the well being of the ecosystemâ€™</a>. Their role is an imperative one in the maintenance of a thriving jungle and a healthy environment.</p>

<p>The tigerâ€™s importance in Malaysian culture is key; it has become a national symbol, appearing on the coat of arms, in the logo of Malaysian institutions like Proton and Maybank and as a nickname for Harimau Malaya, the national football team. The tiger appears often in Malaysian folklore and mythology, sometimes as were-tigers, harimau jadian, or other times in stories with the mouse-deer. It is a symbol of strength and courage in this country and forms an intrinsically unique part of the fabric of Malaysia.</p>

<p>Already we have lost tiger species; the Javan tiger was last sighted in the 1970â€™s and the Bali tiger in the 1930â€™s. The former disappeared due to loss of habitat, and the latter was hunted to extinction. The Malayan tigerâ€™s importance in both the forest and in Malaysian culture means the unique subspecies cannot and should not be next.</p>

<h2 id="loss-of-habitat">Loss of Habitat</h2>

<p>Once upon a time, more than 90% of Peninsula Malaysia was carpeted with jungles and forests. Today, according to the government <a href="https://www.forestry.gov.my/en/2016-06-07-02-53-46/2016-06-07-03-12-29">forestry department</a>, less than 45% of land remains covered. In 2018, Malaysia was among the countries with the <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/life/2019/04/26/report-malaysia-among-countries-with-high-levels-of-deforestation-in-2018/1747149">highest levels of deforestation</a>.</p>

<p>Malaysian jungles used to be connected from the Southern tip of the peninsula all the way up to the Thai border. However due to deforestation, what was once a long corridor that allowed tigers the liberty to range across the entire length of the country, has become a series of islands, shattered and isolated by logging paths, highways, plantations and more. These have forced animals into smaller and smaller spaces of land, making it ever more difficult for them to survive. The destruction of the forest means a shortage of food and prey as well as loss of shelter for tigers. The Sambar Deer, the Malayan Tigerâ€™s primary food source, has also been listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List since 2008, with populations declining due to hunting, industrial exploitation of the jungle, and loss of the vegetation upon which they feed. These islands also push tigers closer to human populations where they are more likely to be hunted and killed.</p>

<p>Initiatives like the <a href="https://www.undp.org/content/dam/malaysia/docs/Central%20Forest%20Spine%20Final%20Pro%20Doc.pdf">Central Forest Spine</a> have been put in place in an attempt to reconnect the jungles of Malaysia, but evidence recorded by Rimau suggests that deforestation and logging are still occurring within these areas.</p>

<h2 id="poaching-for-wildlife-trade">Poaching for Wildlife Trade</h2>

<p>In May of 2019, two Vietnamese poachers were fined RM 1.56 mil, the largest sum yet for a <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2019/05/16/poachers-fined-rm156mil-the-biggest-yet-for-wildlife-crime">wildlife crime</a>. They were also sentenced to two years in prison, after having been convicted on 20 charges. They possessed leopard, tapir and sun bear parts, animals who are threatened and protected, and pleaded guilty to the illegal use of snares. Should they fail to pay the fine, they will be jailed for another 16 years. Among their loot were perhaps the parts of two Malayan tigers, two clouded leopards, and three sun bears. And whilst this case can be seen as a win for a judiciary system that up until recently had remained rather lax on poachers, it must also be highlighted that between the two of them, the men managed to set over 190 snares in the Terengganu area alone.</p>

<p>Snares are steel cable nooses, valued by poachers for their simplicity. They are set up along tiger paths and left unattended for unsuspecting animals to walk into. These animals are then left to a slow and painful death, as the harder you pull the tighter the noose becomes. They are doomed to be collected by local or foreign poachers at a later date. Snares arenâ€™t choosy; they trap any and all animals from deer to tigers. They have also resulted in amputated paws, and three-legged sun bears, tapirs, tigers, and more, handicapped in the jungle. A tiger without its claws cannot hunt, leaving it to die again, a slow and painful death.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/snares.jpg" alt="Illegal snares" /></p>

<p>But why are people still willing to venture so deep into the jungle despite the risks and illegality involved? Tiger parts are some of the most coveted animal parts in the world. Every part is in high demand. Their meat is consumed as a delicacy, their skin, skull, claws and teeth are traded as trophies, and their bones, blood and sexual organs are desired for their mythical medicinal qualities. In fact, in Chinese medicine, practically every part of the tiger has some sort of medicinal value, and with the rising affluence of China, the demand for everything from tiger fat to tiger penises has risen too.</p>

<p>The illegal wildlife trade rakes in anywhere from <a href="https://www.traffic.org/about-us/illegal-wildlife-trade/">USD 7â€“23 billion</a> a year according to a 2016 UN estimate. Itâ€™s no wonder that tigers are facing challenges on this front, especially given the access foreign poachers have through the northern border. Tigers are being hunted and poached ruthlessly and something needs to change in order for this to stop.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-we-need-to-do">What do we need to do?</h2>

<p>Although the situation may currently seem dire, itâ€™s important not to lose hope. There are plenty of people who are passionately committed to saving the Malayan tiger. Two such NGOs are <a href="https://rimbaresearch.org/">Rimba</a> and <a href="http://rimau.ngo/">Rimau</a>, organisations made up of both part time volunteers and full time activists, with backgrounds ranging from documentary film makers to professors and researchers. NGOs such as these are actively working in areas ranging from Belum, in the central part of peninsula Malaysia, to Kenyir Lake, in Terengganu state, to send people into the forest to remove snares and track poachers. However, they advocate for more boots on the ground; to prevent this precious species from dying out, we need rangers with the authority to arrest poachers and deter more from entering our forests.</p>

<p>These organisations are also committed to educating all levels of the population from young children all the way through to politicians. There is a desperate need to embed core values within our society that teach people to treasure the tiger as a symbol of national heritage, to cherish the forests and jungles we are so fortunate to have here in Malaysia, and to generally care more for the flora and fauna we share this country with. The education of young people aims to instill such values. The education of people in power like judges and politicians intends to catalyse more immediate action. It was partly thanks to Rimbaâ€™s programmes which sought to teach judges about the impact of poachers on tigers that a more severe sentencing of the Vietnamese poachers caught earlier this year was possible.</p>

<p>Tiger numbers are dropping quickly. Action needs to be taken now if we hope to save the Malayan tiger from extinction. And thereâ€™s plenty that you can do.</p>

<h2 id="actions-you-can-take">Actions you can take</h2>

<p>Educate yourself on the state of the forests in Malaysia. Which species live in them, and what flora grows? Venture outside and witness for yourself the beauty our spectacles of nature have to offer. Go on a hike to see waterfalls in Taman Negara or Gombak, the ocean in Kuantan or Terengganu. Whatever your preferences, from caves to highlands, islands to deep jungle, there is always somewhere in Malaysia for you to explore. Gain an appreciation for these places â€” they are part of a crumbling national heritage and should be treated as such, in the same way Melaka and Penang have conserved their sites. Then, spread the message too! Influence your communities, your families, schools, workplaces to educate themselves on the natural wonders just outside their doorsteps. Perhaps take them on a walk at FRIM or with the Malaysian Nature Society. Maybe try and live in a slightly more environmentally mindful manner, by paying attention to what you eat and what you consume daily.</p>

<p>If you are Malaysian, investigate the stance of your politicians, so you might hold them accountable. Last year, a coalition of <a href="https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2018/04/11/include-environmental-needs-in-ge14-agendas-politicians-urged">20 NGOs</a> appealed for politicians to include environmental issues in their political agendas. Call for your leaders to take action in protecting the extensive biodiversity we are fortunate enough to have in this country.</p>

<p>If you have the means, you may be interested in donating to one of the NGOs listed above, all of whom are doing great work in actively trying to get boots on the ground by increasing the number of rangers who are able to patrol the jungle, remove snares and catch poachers. In particular, check out Rimba, if you want to see what conservationists are doing, and Rimau, if you want to get directly involved by volunteering.</p>

<p>Even if we make a great, concerted effort, reversing the current trend of tiger decline in Malaysia is a battle that will require tremendous luck and persistence. If nothing is done, we can expect the extinction of the Malayan tiger in the wild by 2022 and within a couple of generations, we will have lost 4 tiger subspecies. The food webs of Malaysian jungles will collapse, forests will suffer, and even more animals will be fated to perish. And for our children? The only place they will still be able to see the Malayan tiger â€” symbol of courage, strength and freedom â€” will be behind bars.</p>

<hr />
<p>This article was written after several months where I volunteered for Rimau, shadowed meetings with Malaysian nature documentary film makers, and took part in
discussions with researchers from Rimba. I would like to acknowledge their hard work and dedication to the cause, and thank them for their willingness
to take people on board and educate them.</p>
