In the past, I have worked under **[Prof. Jin Guo](http://jguo-web.com/)** in the [Knowledge and Software Technology (KAST)](http://jguo-web.com/lab.html) lab, researching the impact of fairness mitigation techniques on privacy preserving Machine Learning.

I participated in the **[2021 AI4Good lab](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/)**, where I worked on Datallite, a dashboard that uses satellite imagery to address data droughts in developing regions to better inform policies that impact social development, specifically education inequality.

I have also volunteered as a web developer with **[Earth Hero](https://www.earthhero.org)**, an awesome group of activists passionate about effectively responding to the climate emergency.  

I drink gallons of tea, thrive in warm weather, and enjoy rock climbing. I have a soft spot for cats and occasionally foster for the **[SPCA](https://www.spca.com/en/)**.
